# PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a very important method for description dimension reduction. In this project, one is provided with an RGB image 'lenna.jpg', a vector can be formed using the red, green and blue component for every pixel in the rgb image. For example, the color of its top left if (226, 137, 123), the corresponding vector is np.array([226, 137, 123]). In this way, the 512x512 lena can be represented by  262144x3 vectors. Perform PCA on these vectors, and compute the approximation by 1, 2, and 3(total=3) components. Obviously, approximations are obtained by inverse PCA, with only part of the eigenvectors forming the transform and inverse matrix. So when 1 component is used, only one eigenvector is taken by the transform and inverse transform. Likewise, when 2 components are used, two eigenvectors are used, and so forth. A prototype python script is provided, one should implement code in the function named:
