# PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a very important method for description dimension reduction. In this project, one is provided with an RGB image 'lenna.jpg', a vector can be formed using the red, green and blue component for every pixel in the rgb image. For example, the color of its top left if (226, 137, 123), the corresponding vector is np.array([226, 137, 123])
